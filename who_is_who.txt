  IMPLEMENTING A SIMPLE JVM IN JAVA AND RUST
  ... I will explain how we might start to implement a JVM from scratch.. then
   we will show how the Rust programming language provides a good alternative
   implementation language for our simple JVM. We will showcase some basic Rust
   language features and show how they can be used to provide a version of our
   JVM that is much cleaner and easier to understand, even if you've never
   seen Rust code before!"""
