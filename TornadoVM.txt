  enhancing the developer experience when working with TornadoVM.
* It was introduced by the TornadoVM team this past week.
  * Key features include:
    * an on-the-fly static checker that scans TornadoVM code in real-time
      and reports any Java features that are not supported by TornadoVM.
  * A dynamic testing framework to simplify the testing process for
    individual TornadoVM tasks.
