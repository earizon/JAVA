# HikariCP Connection Pool 

* JDBC "zero-overhead" production ready JDBC connection pool 

* <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP>
* <https://www.baeldung.com/hikaricp>

* very light ~ 130KB.
* one order of magniture faster than c3p0 (abandoned) dbcp2 tomcat vibur in
  connections/sec. C&P from <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Down-the-Rabbit-Hole>
  """...  In order to make HikariCP as fast as it is, we went down to
    bytecode-level engineering, and beyond. We pulled out every trick we
    know to help the JIT help you. We studied the bytecode output of the
    compiler, and even the assembly output of the JIT to limit key
    routines to less than the JIT inline-threshold. We flattened
    inheritance hierarchies, shadowed member variables, eliminated casts."""
